This project covers day 77 and 78 of the 100 Days of SwiftUI course by Paul Hudson. 

Day 77: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/77
Day 78: https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/78

This small app demostrates:
- Integration of UIKit view PhotoPicker to load photos from user library. 
- Saving data to Document Directory. Creating data structure to hold photos and metadata, and defining them as Codable to save to disk as JSON. 
- Integrating MapKit to show "location" of photo. Location taken from Location data from phone at the moment the photo is loaded.

Thanks to Paul Hudson for building such a nice free course. https://twitter.com/twostraws
